# Project Reflection
This README file contains my reflection on the work I have done with creating a 3d scene in OpenGL from a 2d picture, as well as my thoughts on how the skills and knowledge gained during this project can be applied in future work.

## Designing Software
When approaching software design, I always start by understanding the overarching problem and the requirements needed. I also consider the user's needs and try to design a solution that is intuitive and easy to use. During this project, I further developed my skills and understanding of shaders, 3d rendering, vertex transformation, and lighting, as well as designing for performance and scalability.

## Design Process
I followed a design process that involved several stages, including requirements gathering, conceptualization, testing, and implementation. Having tools such as blender to mess around with models was also a great way to conceptualize some of the design. (It's much harder to create complex models with simple shapes). By following this process, I was able to create a well-thought-out and polished 3D scene that met the project requirements.

## Developing Programs
In developing programs, I run through the following steps. I break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components and expand on them to meet the requirements set forth. During this project, I used new development strategies such as creating reusable components, optimizing performance, and debugging complex issues. Iteration played a critical role in my development process, allowing me to test and refine my code until it met the project's requirements. There were plenty of times I had to go back and forth from the OpenGL window, changing coordinates ever so slightly to create my models.

## Evolution of Development
My approach to developing code evolved throughout the project milestones, as I gained a better understanding of the problem domain and the project requirements. I learned to be more efficient in my coding, using established coding patterns and techniques. I also became more confident in debugging and troubleshooting, which allowed me to solve issues more quickly and effectively. The Shader and Meshes classes played an instrumental role in my evolution of development throughout the project as well, leading me to be more informed about the facets of OpenGL.

## Computer Science in Achieving Goals
Computer science provides a broad range of knowledge and skills that can be applied within my future as a Computer Scientist. Computational graphics and visualizations provide new ways of understanding data and communicating complex ideas. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of computer science's potential and how it can be used to achieve my goals.

## Application in Education and Professional Pathways
The skills and knowledge gained during this project, particularly in computational graphics and visualizations, will be useful in my future educational and professional pathways. These skills will allow me to better communicate and visualize complex ideas, as well as develop new and innovative solutions to problems. As technology continues to evolve, these skills will be increasingly valuable and in demand.
